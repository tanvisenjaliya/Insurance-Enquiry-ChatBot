# Insurance-Enquiry-ChatBot
This chatbot has been created using Google Dialogflow Service. Dialogflow is a basic natural language undersatnding tool that is used to create a conversational applications that can be integrated into mobile apps, websites, interactive voice response systems.  We have used Dialogflow Messenger which enables rich response messages to interact with the client. These messages can be used to provide the end user with more than just text responses. There are a variety of response types to choose from: 
  1.	Images 
  2.	Buttons 
  3.	Suggestion chips 
  4.	Accordion 
  5.	Cards etc.   

We have integrated our chatbot to an HTML webpage that displays our company name, policy offerings, and the chatbot. This webpage enables the user to have a clear overview of the health insurance plans that our company offers and take necessary decisions accordingly while intearcting with the chatbot.
